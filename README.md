This is the script that I am currently using to make my 60% keyboard a bit more useful.

Mostl;y because the software for the keyboard is really janky and I have to download it from some random google drive link that looks fishy, so I'd rather not install that.

It makes capslock more useful by using it as a layer key to access some rudimentary vim motions (hjkl, b, and w), as well as some of the nav cluster keys (u = delete, i = home, o = end, p = backspace)

I also remapped the menu key to delete on the main layer because I have no need for a menu key

One important thing I also had to do was map escape to the backtick/tilde key since it required a tricky ``fn+shift+esc`` to type the ~ ``character``.

There is also a helpful shortcut to insert your email address when ``alt+e`` is pressed.

See the comments in the file for more info about each shortcut.
